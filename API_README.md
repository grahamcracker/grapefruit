API Specs
---------
All requests should be sent to "/api/v1/****", **** replacing the action you want to execute.

When a response from the server contains an email, and authentication_token, SAVE IT. These are required
to send requests that require authentication to the server.

All possible requests will be posted below with their requirements, and examples for them will be found in the section below this:

###User Actions
